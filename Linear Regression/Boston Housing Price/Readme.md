# Boston Housing Machine Learning Project

This project is a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of houses in Boston using the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset contains information on various features of houses in Boston, such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and others. The goal of the project is to build a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses in Boston based on these features.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following software:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started, download the Boston Housing Dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). Alternatively, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Boston-Housing-Price.git


Once you have the dataset and the repository cloned, you can run the `Boston_Housing.ipynb` script to train the machine learning model and make predictions on new data. The script will load the dataset into a Pandas data frame, preprocess the data by scaling the features, and then split the data into training and testing sets. It will then train a machine learning model on the training data and use it to make predictions on the testing data.

### Machine learning project steps

1. Preprocess the data: In this step, we clean and transform the raw data into a format that can be used for machine learning. This might include tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical values. The goal is to create a clean, consistent dataset that accurately represents the problem we want to solve.

2. Detect and handle missing values and outliers: Missing values and outliers can cause problems for machine learning algorithms, so we need to handle them appropriately. Missing values can be imputed (i.e., replaced with estimated values) or removed entirely. Outliers can be identified using statistical techniques and either treated as missing values or removed from the dataset.

3. Select features: Feature selection is the process of choosing which variables to include in our model. We want to select features that are relevant to the problem we are trying to solve, while also avoiding features that are redundant or noisy. There are many techniques for feature selection, including statistical tests, domain knowledge, and machine learning algorithms themselves.

4. Train and evaluate the model: Once we have preprocessed the data and selected features, we can train and evaluate our machine learning model. This involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, choosing an appropriate algorithm, and tuning its hyperparameters. We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. If the model is not performing well, we may need to revisit the earlier steps to improve the quality of the data or select better features.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the machine learning model is evaluated using two metrics - Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the test set. A lower MSE indicates better performance of the model.

- **R-squared (R2) score:** R2 score measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (target variable) that can be explained by the independent variables (predictors) in the model. A high R2 score indicates that the model is a good fit for the data.

In this project, we achieved an MSE of 23.38 and an R2 score of 0.90, which are good results. However, it's important to remember that these metrics do not tell the whole story and it's necessary to consider the overall context of the problem and the model's limitations.

## Conclusion

In this project, we used the Boston Housing Dataset to build a machine-learning model that can predict the prices of houses in Boston based on different features. We achieved good results with the machine learning model, but it's important to remember that there are other factors to consider when evaluating a model's performance. This project can be extended by trying different machine-learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve the performance of the model.
