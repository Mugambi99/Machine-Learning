# Car Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project that aims to predict the prices of used cars using linear regression and Lasso regression algorithms. The project utilizes Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical data of used cars, including various features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition, and price. The dataset is provided in a CSV format and is preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or missing data.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using the following command:
>pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Car_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using linear regression and Lasso regression algorithms.
- `car data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `README.md`: This file, providing documentation and instructions for the project.
# Machine learning project steps

Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here.  This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

**Project Steps**

1. Form a hypothesis.
2. Find and explore the data.
3. (If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target.
4. Clean the data for ML.
5. Pick an error metric.
6. Split your data.
7. Train a model.

## Data

You can download the files we'll use in this project here:

* [car data.csv](https://github.com/Mugambi99/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Car%20Price%20Predictions/car%20data.csv)
* [car_price_prediction.csv](https://github.com/Mugambi99/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Car%20Price%20Predictions/car_price_prediction.csv) - this is the dataset with more features

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Mugambi99/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Linear%20Regression/Car%20Price%20Predictions

2. Install the required libraries using the command mentioned in the "Requirements" section.

3. Open the `Car_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or any other suitable environment.

4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, engineer features, train the linear regression and Lasso regression models, and evaluate their performance.

5. Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics to fine-tune the models and improve their accuracy.

6. You can also modify the `car data.csv` file or replace it with your own dataset to train the models on different data.

## Results

The project aims to predict the prices of used cars with good accuracy using linear regression and Lasso regression algorithms. The performance of the models can be evaluated using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. The results of the models may vary depending on the dataset used, feature engineering techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics employed.

## Conclusion

The car price prediction project using linear regression and Lasso regression is a valuable tool for predicting the prices of used cars, which can be useful for car dealerships, online marketplaces, and car buyers. The project can be extended by incorporating other machine learning algorithms, exploring different feature engineering techniques, and evaluating the models on larger datasets for more accurate predictions.
